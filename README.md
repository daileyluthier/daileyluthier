- 👋 Hi, I’m @daileyluthier
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about computer science and software development as a whole. My degree focused on Java environments but I want to learn more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Java, Python, and C++.
- 💞️ I’m not actively looking to collaborate at the moment, but when I feel more comfortable developing then this will change.
- 📫 You can reach me at daileyluthier@live.com or linkedin.com/in/dailey-michael/
